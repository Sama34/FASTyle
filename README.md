FASTyle is a simple plugin which replaces MyBB's templates, stylesheets and settings saving process with a more user friendly and faster alternative exploiting the power of AJAX calls.

Using this plugin you can save your templates, stylesheets and settings without reloading the page every time. Applying small or big changes to your themes or board becomes times easier and faster using FASTyle.

You can save your stylesheets/templates without touching the saving button, using the keyboard shortcut CTRL (CMD for Mac users) + S.
