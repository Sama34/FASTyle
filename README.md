FASTyle is a simple plugin which replaces MyBB's templates and stylesheets saving process with a more user friendly and faster alternative exploiting the power of AJAX calls.

Using this plugin you can save your templates and stylesheets without reloading the page every time. Applying small or big changes to your themes becomes times easier and faster using FASTyle.

You can save your stylesheets/templates without touching the saving button, using the keyboard shortcut CTRL (CMD for Mac users) + S.
