FASTyle is an all-in-one suite which helps speed up MyBB theme developersâ€™ and administrators workflow by vastly improving templates, stylesheets and javascripts editing. FASTyle comes with its powerful manager which lets you manage your board resources within a single browser tab. A lot of options are available to let you build and deploy your themes hundreds times faster than usual.

### Twig conversion helper
This FASTyle version has been built to help developers convert MyBB templates to Twig. To the 2.0 standard version it adds:
* Twig and PHP files support;
* a split view mode to work on 2 files simultaneously (typically a Twig template and the corresponding PHP file);
* a handy and basic function ("Twigify") to quickly convert a MyBB template to Twig syntax;
* another basic function ("PSR-2") to adapt PHP files to PSR-2 syntax (tabs to spaces, curly brackets on the same line as conditionals, space after loops and conditionals openers).
