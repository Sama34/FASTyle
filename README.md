FASTyle is a simple plugin which replaces MyBB's templates, stylesheets and settings saving process with a more user friendly and faster alternative exploiting the power of AJAX calls.

Using this plugin you can save your templates, stylesheets and settings without reloading the page every time. Applying small or big changes to your themes or board becomes times easier and faster using FASTyle.

You can save your stylesheets/templates without touching the saving button, using the keyboard shortcut CTRL (CMD for Mac users) + S.

### Installation and usage
Upload the file fastyle.php to your /inc/plugins folder. Then Install & Activate through the admin control panel and enjoy FASTyle.

Once you click on the saving buttons of either settings, templates or stylesheets, or you press CTRL/CMD + S on your keyboard, the Save button will be replaced by 3 jumping dots indicating that the operation is in progress. In the end, the button will be restored and a jGrowl notification will appear in the top right corner of your screen indicating either the success or the failure of the operation.
